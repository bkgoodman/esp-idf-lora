# This is an Espressif ESP-IDF project for the Lilygo TTGO Lora board

It is based off the work of the ESP-IDF LoRa libraries from https://github.com/Inteform/esp32-lora-library and the SSD1309 OLED library from https://github.com/nopnop2002/esp-idf-ssd1306

You should only have to run `idf.py menuconfig` and set your pin numbers and callsigns in the "LoRa Configuration" top menu.
